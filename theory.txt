2. Difference between a library and framework ?

Both libraries and frameworks are reusable code written by someone else.
A library is like going to Ikea. You already have a home, but you need a bit of help with furniture. You don’t feel like making your own table from scratch. Ikea allows you to pick and choose different things to go in your home. You are in control.
A framework, on the other hand, is like building a model home. You have a set of blueprints and a few limited choices when it comes to architecture and design. Ultimately, the contractor and blueprint are in control. And they will let you know when and where you can provide your input.
When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.

What is CDN ? Why do we use it ?

A content delivery network (CDN) is a geographically dispersed network of servers and data centers.
The goal of CDN is to facilitate increased web performance and high availability by locating web content copies closer to the end-users.

What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN ?

The React library provides two versions of its JavaScript files: react.development.js and react.production.js. These files serve different purposes and are typically used in different stages of the development and deployment process. When serving these files via a Content Delivery Network (CDN), there are a few key differences between them:
In development mode, we can enable and utilize React developer tools, devtools profiler, debugging environment attached with source code. We can utilize various functionalities such as Hot Module Replacement, diagnostics so that development environment will help to debug code.
In production mode, compression and minification of Javascript and other resources happens to reduce size of the code which is not the case when it comes to development mode. Performance will be much faster in production mode when compared to development mode.
